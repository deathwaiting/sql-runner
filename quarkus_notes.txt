notes
- quarkus.datasource.db-kind is actually mandatory, without it, i get warning:
"The Agroal dependency is present but no JDBC datasources have been defined."
The documentation doesn't mention that!

- if the datasource is not configured, i can't inject it anywhere, and the build fails because quarkus uses build time
injection.

- to set quarkus.datasource.jdbc, which is a parent of another properties in yaml , you will need to add '~:true' as
key-value in it sub-structure.

- i had problems with smallrye monitoring, it thrown errors that there are "multiple producers" , so i disabled it from
the gradle file
