notes
- quarkus.datasource.db-kind is actually mandatory, without it, i get warning:
"The Agroal dependency is present but no JDBC datasources have been defined."
The documentation doesn't mention that!

- if the datasource is not configured, i can't inject it anywhere, and the build fails because quarkus uses build time
injection.

- to set quarkus.datasource.jdbc, which is a parent of another properties in yaml , you will need to add '~:true' as
key-value in it sub-structure.
https://quarkus.io/guides/config#configuration-key-conflicts

- i had problems with smallrye monitoring, it thrown errors that there are "multiple producers" , so i disabled it from
the gradle file

- i read an article that used vertx reactive clients for relational database and apparently
it didn't perform well. more over r2dbc supported more database, was more popular, provided
better features and better encapsulations, spring-r2dbc-client supported multiple databases out of box
, which meant i could just change the configurations in application.yml while importing all the
database drivers into the project.
quarkus clients on the other hand didn't support that as i remember, and i had to match the configuration
with the loaded reactive client, the api was not easy and a lot of boiler plate for values extraction
seemed in the horizon, r2dbc on the other hand returned the rows as List<Map<String,Object>> which
could be easily converted to JsonObject.
So, i ended up with using r2dbc instead and ditching the quarkus ways.

- r2dbc uses project reactor ,while quarkus uses mutiny, so i have to use 'io.smallrye.reactive:mutiny-reactor' artifact
to convert between them

- there were several dependency conflicts between quarkus, r2dbc and some r2dbc drivers:
-- quarkus 1.9.2.FINAL had a dependency on spring-core 5.2.9, while spring-r2dbc client 1.2 had a dependency on spring
 5.3
-- quarkus 1.9.2.FINAL h2 test had a dependency on h2 1.4.197, but r2dbc driver had one on 1.4.200
-- so i had to downgrade r2dbc to 1.1.4.RELEASE which also uses spring 5.2.9, and force h2 version in the
project to 1.4.200

- unlike exceptions in spring, error are swallon inside the reactive chain, you have to add events handlers for
Uni to even log errors at certain stage, still have not figured how to bubble the errors up to the response using the
reactive chain, it seems possible though when using jax-rs and resteasy.

- returning something other than Uni<String> for vertx @ConsumeEvent, caused the returned message to never come causing
timeout
--

- quarkus caching
    -- it uses caffeine cache implementation under the hood, which is based on google gauava cache, and supports both
    sync and async cache loading
    -- this means it is possible to cache results returned by methods returning Uni<?>.
    -- the cache is annotation based , but can be configured via application.yml
    -- it probably uses proxies, so annotations only works on public methods.
    -- didn't test trying to inject the backend caffeine instance and manipulating it directly.
- auth:
    -- quarkus supports several authentication methods out of the box [OIDC, OAUTH2, smallRye-JWT, basic, form based]
    https://quarkus.io/guides/security#identity-providers
    -- Basic and form based are provided by default
    -- Using Basic it possible to set embedded users in the application.yml or inside a file in the classpath
    https://quarkus.io/guides/security-properties#quarkus-elytron-security_quarkus.security.users.embedded.algorithm
    -- it is also possible to fetch the user info using different ways, using JPA, JDBC, OAuth2, and from property files.
    https://quarkus.io/guides/security-built-in-authentication
    -- it is possible to override security in tests, by disabling it, or setting a certain user for the test
    https://quarkus.io/guides/security-testing#configuring-user-information
    -- auth configuration of API's , policies , roles , and permissions can be set in the application.yml , which is
    is a nice feature.
    -- Http Digest authentication is not supported, or i couldn't just configure it

 - Methods annotated with @ConsumeEvent can have objects as parameters, which will be serialized to messages between
 verticles , this is important, because it will make type check easier when working with multiple verticles.
